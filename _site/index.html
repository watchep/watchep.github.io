    <h1>A New Program to Advance Fundamental Science</h1>
  <p>
    WATCHEP is a training program with the goal of developing a workforce of experts in computational high-energy physics.
    These experts are needed to help make the most of the complex experimental projects and high-volume datasets.
    They will be the "computing ambassadors" to the high-energy physics community.
  </p>
  <p>
    Graduate student trainees from the partner universities will complete a tailored instructional curriculum and a supervised research project in a relevant topical area.
    Trainees are provided financial support during their training period in the program.
    We expect this program will contribute to the DOE workforce in high-energy physics on the various scientific frontiers.
  </p>
