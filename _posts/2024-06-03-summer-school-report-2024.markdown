The DOE Computational HEP training programs combined again for the 2024 summer school, this year at Fermilab.
The sessions held May 20-24 introduced hands-on systems administration workshops, high-performance computing lectures, and career panel discussions.

This training event was supported by the four Department of Energy programs [TAC-HEP](https://tac-hep.org/), [WATCHEP](https://watchep.org/),  [C2-THE-P2](https://www.niu.edu/clas/physics/academics/graduate/traineeship.shtml), and [LGT4HEP](https://lgt4hep.github.io/).

There were three major changes with respect to last year's program:
1. The program was held at Fermilab, giving access to the DOE national laboratory system.
2. The program included two cohorts of students, as the second 2-year cohort of each program joined the first cohort.
3. The program included more hands-only exercises, focused on cluster administration, high-performance computing, and containerization.

A career panel composed of DOE program manager, DOE lab senior leadership, and university faculty introduced students to the breadth of opportunities for computational high-energy physicists in academia and the DOE.

The summer school was very successful in helping to build community within the cohorts. Student trainees had a chance to exchange news about their research projects and their experience in high-energy physics.
