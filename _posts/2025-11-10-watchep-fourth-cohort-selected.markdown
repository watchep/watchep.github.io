We are excited to announce the fourth WATCHEP training cohort, for the period 2026-2027. 
A total of eight students were selected in a competitive process that took into account their proposed research, community engagement, initiative, and leadership.
New funding from DOE OHEP allowed us to introduce a fourth focus area--Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning--to join the existing areas of Hardware-Software Co-Design, Collaborative Software Infrastructure, and High-Performance Software and Algorithms.

WATCHEP is a training program with the goal of developing a workforce of experts in computational high-energy physics. 
Graduate student trainees from the partner universities will complete a tailored instructional curriculum and a supervised research project in a relevant topical area. 
Trainees are provided financial support during their training period in the program.

This cohort is divided into four major focus areas: collaborative software infrastructure, hardware-software co-design, high-performance computing, and artificial intelligence / machine learning.
They will work with university and laboratory mentors on computational research projects and follow advanced online training modules. 
The cohort will also participate in a series of hands-on summer training sessions during their two-year term.
