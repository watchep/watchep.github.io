The WATCHEP program has been awarded new funding to expand training into the key area of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
The addition of this fourth focus area highlights the importance of AI/ML in high-energy physics and in the DOE computing sphere.
We look forward to welcoming the first cohort of AI/ML trainees, starting in January 2026.

WATCHEP began in 2022 with three research focus areas:
* Hardware-Software Co-Design
* Collaborative Software Infrastructure
* High-Performance Software and Algorithms

Now, with supplemental funding from the Department of Energy Office of High-Energy Physics, we have been able to add a fourth focus area for this cohort: <em>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</em>.
While past research projects may have touched on AI/ML as an essential tool, the new funding will allow us to welcome trainees who have AI/ML as a primary research focus.
