We are excited to announce the second WATCHEP training cohort, for the period 2024-2026. 
A total of six students were selected in a competitive process that took into account their proposed research, community engagement, initiative, and leadership.
Read more about this year's cohort in the ["Trainees" tab](/trainees) in the top menu.

* Jade Chismar (Univ. of California, San Diego)
* Miles Cochran-Branson (Univ. of Washington)
* Alex Golub (Univ. of Washington)
* Luke Grossman (Univ. of California, Berkeley)
* Charlie Hultquist (Univ. of California, Berkeley)
* Hadley Santana Queiroz (Univ. of California, Berkeley)

WATCHEP is a training program with the goal of developing a workforce of experts in computational high-energy physics. 
Graduate student trainees from the partner universities will complete a tailored instructional curriculum and a supervised research project in a relevant topical area. 
Trainees are provided financial support during their training period in the program.

This cohort is divided into three major focus areas: collaborative software infrastructure, hardware-software co-design, and high-performance computing. 
They will work with university and laboratory mentors on computational research projects and follow advanced online training modules. 
The cohort will also participate in a series of hands-on summer training sessions during their two-year term.
