We are pleased to announce that the selection process for the 2023-2025 WATCHEP training cohort has started.
The 2-year training program is intended to provide opportunities for students in computational high-energy physics from a [group of six Western universities](\about).
Please visit the ["Apply" tab](/apply) in the top menu for information and access to the application form.
All submissions received before March 1, 2023 will be considered for selection to the cohort starting on April 1, 2023 and ending on March 30, 2025.

Selected student trainees will join a cohort in a dedicated online curriculum and hands-on development at the annual summer school.
They will then work with a university and laboratory mentor on a project in computational high-energy physics.
Financial awards of up to $55K are intended to cover tuition, fees, and stipend during the training program duration.

Participants in this DOE-sponsored program must be U.S. citizens or permanent residents.
