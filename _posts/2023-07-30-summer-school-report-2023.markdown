The inaugural cohort of WATCHEP students participated in the first computational HEP traineeship summer school, held July 24-28 at Princeton University.
WATCHEP joined forces with the TAC-HEP and C2-THE-P2 training programs to provide an intense schedule of hands-on demos, coding jam exercises, and big picture R&D talks.
Student trainees also presented lightning talks about their research projects.
