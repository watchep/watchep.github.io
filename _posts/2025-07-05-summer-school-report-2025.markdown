The Department of Energy Computational High-Energy Physics training programs combined again for the 2025 summer school, hosted by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and University of California, Berkeley.
The sessions held June 23-27 introduced hands-on development exercises, high-performance computing lectures, open-source software community introductions, and career panel discussions.

This training event was supported by the four Department of Energy programs [TAC-HEP](https://tac-hep.org/), [WATCHEP](https://watchep.org/),  [C2-THE-P2](https://www.niu.edu/clas/physics/academics/graduate/traineeship.shtml), and [LGT4HEP](https://lgt4hep.github.io/).

The trainees learned about virtualization in the DOE computing complex, computer networking from ESnet, and tools for development like Git, debuggers, and AI agents.
A new panel compared the science workflows for different experimental projects in high-energy physics: energy, cosmic, and neutrino.

A career panel composed of DOE program manager, DOE lab senior leadership, lab staff, and university faculty introduced students to the breadth of opportunities for computational high-energy physicists in academia and the DOE.

The summer school program concluded with special tours of the Advanced Light Source under the landmark 184-inch cyclotron dome at LBNL and the Perlmutter supercomputer in the NERSC operations center.

The summer school was very successful in helping to build community within the cohorts. Student trainees had a chance to exchange news about their research projects and their experience in high-energy physics.
