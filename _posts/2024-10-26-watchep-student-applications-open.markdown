We are pleased to announce that the selection process for the 2025-2026 WATCHEP training cohort has started.
The 2-year training program is intended to provide opportunities for students in computational high-energy physics from a [group of six Western universities](\about).
Please visit the ["Apply" tab](/apply) in the top menu for information and access to the application form.
All submissions received on or before **November 18, 2024** will be considered for selection to the cohort starting on January 1, 2025 and ending on December 31, 2026.

Selected student trainees will join a cohort in a dedicated online curriculum and hands-on development at the annual summer school.
They will then work with a university and laboratory mentor on a project in computational high-energy physics.
Financial awards of up to $70K are intended to cover tuition, fees, and stipend during the training program duration.

Participants in this DOE-sponsored program must be U.S. citizens or permanent residents.
