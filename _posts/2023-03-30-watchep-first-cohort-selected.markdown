We are excited to announce the inaugural WATCHEP training cohort for 2023-2025. 
A total of six students were selected in a competitive process that took into account their proposed research, community engagement, initiative, and leadership.
Read more about this year's cohort in the ["Fellows" tab](/fellows) in the top menu.

* Abdelrahman Elabd (Univ. of Washington)
* Matt Kwiecien (Univ. of California, Santa Cruz)
* Eric Le (Univ. of California, Irvine)
* Luc Le Pottier (Univ. of California, Berkeley)
* Russell Marroquin Solares (Univ. of California, San Diego)
* Johannes Wagner (Univ. of California, Berkeley)

WATCHEP is a training program with the goal of developing a workforce of experts in computational high-energy physics. 
Graduate student trainees from the partner universities will complete a tailored instructional curriculum and a supervised research project in a relevant topical area. 
Trainees are provided financial support during their training period in the program.

This cohort is divided into two major focus areas: hardware-software co-design and collaborative software infrastructure. 
They will work with university and laboratory mentors on computational research projects and follow advanced online training modules. 
The cohort will also participate in a series of hands-on summer training sessions.
