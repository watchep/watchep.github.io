We are pleased to announce that the selection process for the 2026-2027 WATCHEP training cohort has started.
The 18-month training program is intended to provide opportunities for students in computational high-energy physics from a [group of six Western universities](\about).
Please visit the ["Apply" tab](/apply) in the top menu for information and access to the application form.
All submissions received on or before **October 31, 2025** will be considered for selection to the cohort starting on January 1, 2026 and ending on June 30, 2027.
There may be a possibility of extension to a full 2-year term, subject to funding availability.

Selected student trainees will join a cohort in a dedicated online curriculum and hands-on development at the annual summer school.
They will then work with a university and laboratory mentor on a project in computational high-energy physics.
Financial awards of up to $70K are intended to cover tuition, fees, and stipend during the training program duration.

With supplemental funding from the Deparment of Energy Office of High-Energy Physics, we have been able to add a fourth focus area for this cohort:
* Hardware-Software Co-Design
* Collaborative Software Infrastructure
* High-Performance Software and Algorithms
* Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

Participants in this DOE-sponsored program must be U.S. citizens or permanent residents.
