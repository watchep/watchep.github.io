We are delighted to announce that the Computational HEP 2025 Summer School will be held June 23-27, 2025 at UC Berkeley and Berkeley Lab.
This will be a joint event led by [WATCHEP](https://watchep.org), with participation from the [TAC-HEP](https://tac-hep.org), [C2-THE-P2](https://www.niu.edu/clas/physics/academics/graduate/traineeship.shtml), and [LGT4HEP](https://lgt4hep.github.io) training programs supported by DOE Office of High-Energy Physics.
Students in the training programs will attend lectures on cutting-edge topics and gain experience with hands-on exercises with university and DOE lab mentors.
They will also tour the facilities at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
