The Western Advanced Training for Computational High-Energy Physics (WATCHEP) exists to train the next generation of scientific computing experts.

The training program includes a tailored graduate-level curriculum and cutting-edge research projects with university and laboratory computing experts. 
The goal is for students to work through the entire lifecycle of a project.
The formal curriculum includes advanced topics in technical areas plus communication, leadership, and ethics.
Trainees who have completed the 2-year program will be well prepared to contribute to scientific computing workforce in the DOE HEP mission.

We are a strategic consortium of large public universities, national laboratories, and supercomputing centers with expertise in a wide range of computing topics.
Science interests cover the HEP energy, cosmic, and intensity frontiers.
