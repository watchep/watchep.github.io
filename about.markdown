The Western Advanced Training for Computational High-Energy Physics (WATCHEP) exists to train the next generation of scientific computing experts.

The training program includes a tailored graduate-level curriculum and cutting-edge research projects with university and laboratory computing experts. 
The goal is for students to work through the entire lifecycle of a project.
The formal curriculum includes advanced topics in technical areas plus communication, leadership, and ethics.
Trainees who have completed the 2-year program will be well prepared to contribute to scientific computing workforce in the DOE HEP mission.
Participants in this DOE-sponsored program must be U.S. citizens or permanent residents.
They will focus their research project efforts in one of the following focus areas:
* Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
* Collaborative Software Infrastructure
* Hardware-Software Co-Design
* High-Performance Software and Algorithms

We are a strategic consortium of large public universities, national laboratories, and supercomputing centers with expertise in a wide range of computing topics.
Science interests cover the HEP energy, cosmic, and intensity frontiers.

* Oregon State University
* University of California, Berkeley
* University of California, Irvine
* University of California, San Diego
* University of California, Santa Cruz
* University of Washington
* Brookhaven National Laboratory
* Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory
* Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory

The program PI is Jason Nielsen from the Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics at the University of California, Santa Cruz.
