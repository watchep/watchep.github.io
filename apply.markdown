The Western Advanced Training for Computational High-Energy Physics (WATCHEP) is a DOE-sponsored program to train the next generation of scientific computing experts.

The training program includes a tailored graduate-level curriculum and cutting-edge research projects with university and laboratory computing experts. 
The goal is for students to work through the entire lifecycle of a computational high-energy physics project.
The formal curriculum includes advanced topics in technical areas plus communication, leadership, and ethics.
Trainees who have completed the 2-year program will be well prepared to contribute to scientific computing workforce in the DOE HEP mission.

Financial awards of up to $65K are intended to cover tuition, fees, travel, and stipend during the training program duration.
