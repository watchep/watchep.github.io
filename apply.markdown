The Western Advanced Training for Computational High-Energy Physics (WATCHEP) is a DOE-sponsored program to train the next generation of scientific computing experts.

The training program includes a tailored graduate-level curriculum and cutting-edge research projects with university and laboratory computing experts. 
The goal is for students to work through the entire lifecycle of a computational high-energy physics project.
The formal curriculum includes advanced topics in technical areas plus communication, leadership, and ethics.
Trainees who have completed the 2-year program will be well prepared to contribute to scientific computing workforce in the DOE HEP mission.

Financial awards of up to $55K are intended to cover tuition, fees, and stipend during the training program duration.

Interested graduate students from participating institutions are encouraged to complete [the application form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdvEODzRkg6gJobCbyu8_OG47HGfqw3pbPGqG3P8FmMe2z4tQ/viewform) before March 1, 2023.
