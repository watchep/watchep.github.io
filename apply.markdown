The Western Advanced Training for Computational High-Energy Physics (WATCHEP) is a DOE-sponsored program to train the next generation of scientific computing experts.

The training program includes a tailored graduate-level curriculum and cutting-edge research projects with university and laboratory computing experts. 
The goal is for students to work through the entire lifecycle of a computational high-energy physics project.
The formal curriculum includes advanced topics in technical areas plus communication, leadership, and ethics.
Trainees who have completed the 2-year program will be well prepared to contribute to scientific computing workforce in the DOE HEP mission.

Financial awards will cover tuition, fees, travel, and stipend during the training program duration.

Applications for the fourth cohort of students from participating institutions are closed.
